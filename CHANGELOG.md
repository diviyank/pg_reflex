# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- `drop_reflex_ivm(view_name)` and `drop_reflex_ivm(view_name, cascade)` for removing IMVs and all artifacts
- `reflex_reconcile(view_name)` for rebuilding IMVs from source data
- TRUNCATE trigger support (clears intermediate and target on source TRUNCATE)
- Targeted group refresh (only affected groups re-materialized, not the full target table)
- CTE decomposition (each CTE becomes a sub-IMV, passthrough outer queries become VIEWs)
- MERGE-based delta processing (replaces INSERT ON CONFLICT for better performance)
- View name validation (rejects names with special characters to prevent SQL injection)
- Duplicate view name detection (returns error instead of crashing)
- PostgreSQL logging for key operations (`info!` on create/drop/reconcile, `warning!` on errors)
- 111 tests (53 unit + 58 integration) covering all aggregate types, CTEs, JOINs, edge cases
- 17 SQL benchmark scripts covering scales from 1K to 5M rows
- Apache 2.0 license

### Fixed
- SQL parser no longer panics on malformed input (returns error string instead of crashing PostgreSQL backend)
- SQL injection vectors eliminated via parameterized queries and input validation
- Catalog queries (`information_schema.columns`) now use parameterized queries

### Supported
- PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
- Aggregates: SUM, COUNT, COUNT(*), AVG, MIN, MAX
- DISTINCT, GROUP BY, WHERE, INNER/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN
- Non-recursive CTEs (decomposed into sub-IMVs)
